# Candid Dart

## Quick Start

1. Depend on it.
```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^2.3.3
  candid_dart:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/AstroxNetwork/candid_dart
```
2. Add your candid files (`.did`) to project `lib` directory, required.
3. Run `dart run build_runner build` or `dart run build_runner watch`.
